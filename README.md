# Go Concepts Learning Repository

This repository is a structured guide for learning core Go (Golang) concepts, organized by topic. Each folder contains example `.go` files that demonstrate key features of the language.

## üìÅ 01_basics

### 1. `variables.go`
Demonstrates variable declaration:
- Using `var` keyword with explicit type
- Using short declaration syntax (`:=`)

### 2. `data_types.go`
Covers basic Go data types:
- `int`, `float64`, `bool`, `string`

### 3. `constants.go`
Shows how to declare and use constants:
- Immutable values declared with `const`

### 4. `comments.go`
Illustrates Go's commenting styles:
- Single-line comments (`//`)
- Multi-line comments (`/* ... */`)

## üìÅ 02_control_flow

### 1. `if_else.go`
Covers conditional statements:
- `if`, `else if`, and `else` for control branching based on conditions.

### 2. `switch.go`
Demonstrates the use of `switch` statements:
- Cleaner alternative to multiple `if-else` checks.
- Supports multiple values in a single `case`.

### 3. `loops.go`
Shows different looping patterns in Go:
- Traditional `for` loop (like `for i := 0; i < n; i++`)
- While-like `for` loop
- Infinite `for` loop with `break` control
